            <p>With Battlefield becomeing a more and more recognized franchise each year, more and more people are playing the Battlefield titles. At the same time, fans of the Call of Duty fanchise (for the most part) have been straying from their familiar belifs about Call of Duty and have begun to play battlefield instead. This can be seen as both a good and bad thing from both the perspextive of the gamer and the developer.</p>

		<div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>While Call of Duty in the past has been widley successfull and the most popular first person shoter franchises, what seems to be killing it is the lack of innovation. Every Call of Duty that has been released since 2008 has been running off of the same graphics engine. The only reason they look slightly different is because of minor changes to brightness levels. Battlefield on th otherhand has developed 3 new graphics engines in its existance, each one getting better looking than the last.</p>

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Fans of the Call of Duty franchise are also dissapointed in how little different the game content is than the previous title. This is mainly due to the fact that Call of Duty development companys only have 8 months to develop and entire game because Call of Duty has been releaseing a new title every year for the past 6 years. This is almost litterally impossible, making the developers releases games that are not finished yet and have almost the exact content as the last title. DICE (the main developer of the battlefield franchise) on the other hand took over 3 years to make Battlefield 4 from Battlefield 3, leaving plenty of time to introduce new content in the game, pleasing their fans.</p>

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>This being said however, Battlefield has announced another title after only a year Battlefield 4 was released. This sounds earily similar to the Call of Duty method. However, the next Battlefield title, Battlefield:Hardline, is being developed by an entirerly new development team, Viscerall games. While they will be utilizing DICE's graphics engine, they will have new ideas than the people over at DICE (especially since DICE makes war games and Viscerall makes horror games). Battlefield: Hardline is also going to be a cops and robbers kind of shooter which is radcally different than the normal Bttlefield theme of war.</p>
