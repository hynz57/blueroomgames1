	<div class="text"><p> With Battlefield 4 being out for so lnog, it is good to take a look back on the changes the developers have made since the release of the game. The game started off terribly with some of the worst netcoding in a first person shooter to date. It was also accompanyed by nearly guarunteed game crashes at certain points of the game.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><p> This being said, the game has had one of the most amazing comebacks in first person shooter title history. The constant updates that improve the game have made fans of the franchise very happy and there are still many to come due to DICE's installment of the CTE servers in order to test out changes they may want to make to the game.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><p> Battlefield 4 is one of my favorite FPS games of all time.</p></div>
