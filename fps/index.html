            <h5 class="subheader"><p>In case you cant read, the picture next to this text is that of Battlefield: Hardline, the next First Person Shooter to be released in the Battlefield franchise. Unlike all of the other Battlefields, Battefield: Hardline is being created by the developers of Viscerall games, the creators of the Dead Sapce franchise. Now, hold onto your pants my Battlefield fan boys, DICE (the usuall developers of the Battlefield games) is allowing Viscerall games to use their super awesome graphics engine, Frostbite 3. This will make it so the game will have the asthetics of all of the other Battlefield games. However, Battlefield: Hardline is going to be the most unique Battlefield yet! Rather than just being another war video game, Battlefield: Hardline is going to be a cops and robbers game! I know, right! Its gonna be like GTA mixed with Battlefield, mixed with awesome juice! The game is expected to be released early 2015, but dont be suprised is it gets delayed. The Frostbite engine has a tendency to be, how do I put this? Broken? But dont be scared, Viscerall Games is gong to take their time with this title and it is going to be awesome!</p></h5>

                <h6 class="subheader">Battlefield 4 still has another DLC on the way in the near future. Dont jump ship yet, Battlefield 4 still is extreamly fun!. DICE is also running CTE servers constantly, working on new updates to make the game even more awesome! For example, HUD icons will be able to be adjusted, removing the bliock of sight due to the extreame brightness and quantity of icons on-screen in the same area. Another example is when using the defribrilator, any downed allies who are eligible for a revive will have the revive icon above them. The only problem is, you, the medic, do not know how much time you have to revive your allie before they re-spawn. To make it easier, the revive icon above a downed allie will be sourounded by a circle that will diminish as the downed allie gets closed to death. This will let the medic know how much time they have to revive said allie. Dice also plans on making huge wepon balencing improvments to many of the weapons that the players have considered "over-powered". DICE is also re-doing almost all of the rush gamemode layouts by either giving a team more vehicles, or by re-positioning the m-coms, extending the comabt areas that will allow more angles of attack. All in all is that playing Battlefield 4 will be much a much more fun expierience in the next update.</h6>
