            <p>It has been about a year since Titanfall has been released for all platforms. This game was praised by hundreds of the most trusted game reviewers and won dozens of awards. Nowadays, noboby is talking about it. As people often say, the stars that shine the brightest are extinguished soonest. While Respawn (the developers of Titanfall) plan on creating more DLC for the game, will it be enough to revive the game's reputation for being amazing?</p>

            <p>First of all, I am not trying to bash Titanfall, I think it is a great game. But, I have not played it in mothes for a few reasons.  The entire game is online so if you dont have a internet connection, you cant play it. The game DOES NOT HAVE A SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN. I am sick of people saying that there is a campaign to this game. Titanfal's sad excuse of a campaign is just regualr multiplayer matches with some character dialouge in the background. At the end of the campaign, you dont even care at all about any of the characters. I couldent even remember their names! I feel that even if it had some sort of co-op game mode, just something other than the regular multiplayer, this game would seem much denser.</p>

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Lets get to the multiplayer, which is about 98% of the games content. There are only like 6 gamemodes and 3 of them are almost the exact same thing, kill things. There are a couple of unique gamemodes but they are still only about 3 gamemodes in Titanfall that are distinguishable. Going on to customization, it is very similar to Call of Duty's class system. You make multiple classes that have your loadout. The only propblem is that there are only 8 primary weapons and 3 of them are the same thing, there are only 3 secondary weapons, there are 3 anti-titan wepons, the point is there is very little customization in terms of wepon usage. There are only about 3 attacthments to choose from for many of the weapons and almost all of them are repeated. It may just be because I am coming form Battlefield 4 where there are about 40 primary wepons, 12 secondary weapons and 100+ attacthents for them, but then again, this game has the Titans.  </p>

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Let us get to the Titans, the cool super robots that this game was praised for. While it is very cool to fight in a giant freakin mech, again, the customization kills it for me. There are 3 Titans that are all very different but then there are only 5 Titan weapons and a few of them behave similarly. There are a range of Titan abilitys to choose from, but coming from battlefield whener there are millions of customizable options, this doesnt cut it for me.</p>
          </div>

           <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Something that I love about Titanfall is the movement. being able to get around preaty much anywhere is prety cool. It makes for elaborate flanking routes. The free movement combined with intense firefights make this game's combat very unique.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>I think that Titanfall could have been something much bigger than a one week wonder. If there was simple more to it. Add more maps, gamemodes, and weapons to keep your fans hooked for longer than 5 minutes. While thi game can be very exiting at first, it get boring really fast because evey game is the same as the last.</p>
