        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>With Grand Theft Auto V (5) being out for almost a year now, is it sfe to say that this has been the most successfull Rockstar to have been created? Thus game has an amazing story and an awesome multiplayer. The open world is giant and fun to explor. The NPCs (non-playable characters) are interactive and funny, as is the entire game. This game ha won doezens of awards and is one of the highest rated games, competing with Skyrim for the best game ever (although thats kind of unfair because Skyrim doennt have a multiplayer). While I like Red Dead Redemptions story the best, it's multiplayer was lacking. So therefore, in my opinion, GTA V is the best game Rockstar has made so far because simply everything in the game is amazing. Who knows, mabey GTA VI (6) will be better! </p>

 <div class="row">
          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>GTA V has been out for about a year now and they have released a lot of content. Apposed to the usuall method of DLC distribution, Rockstar released little, free content additions to the game every few monthes. They have also released seasonal DLC with content that was appropriate for the time of year. For example, they released a fourth of july pack that gave players limited time access to fourth of jult themed items such as fireworks and patriotic outfits. However, now that the year is coming to a close, and they have already released their seasonal pacls, will they make more. Granted, they did not do all of the holidays like Halloween of Easter or Thanksgiving. There may just be even more content down the road for this game.</p>
