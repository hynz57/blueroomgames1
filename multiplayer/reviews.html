		<div class="text"><p>With Bungi's recent wrap up of their beta for their highly anticipated MMO/RPG, Destiny, here is my sinscere opinion on the game so far.</p><p>First of all, the gameplay that I expierienced was only in the beta stage, meaning that it was not the final product of the title. This being said however, I had an absolute blast playing this game's beta. With a combination of an in depth story filled with lore and adventure, fun co-op missions with other players and a unique multipler expierience, Destiny offers an in depth and fun expierience that revolves around your character.</div>
